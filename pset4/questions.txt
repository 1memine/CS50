0.  JPEG -- 16kk, GIF -- 256, BMP -- from 1 to 1.84*10^19
1.  GIF
2.  Loseless compression allows to restore data without any losses
3.  JPEG
4. What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file
system?
Two things:
    1. The system modifies the filename's first character to signal that it has
       been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
       (Most OSs simply remove the file's reference from the containing dir.)
    2. The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list
       of free clusters.
    The file's data is never touched.
5.  overwrite whole disk with random data or zeroes
6.  stdint.h is a standart library with int types with specific width (max and min)
7.  to increase portability of programm and to ensure proper usage, sizeof(int) can vary in different systems
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    BYTE - 1
    DWORD- 4
    LONG - 4
    WORD - 2
9.  0x42 0x4D, ASCII: BM, dec: 6677
10. bfSize is member of BITMAPFILEHEADER struct, represents size of bmp file in bytes
    biSize is member of BITMAPINFOHEADER struct, represents size of struct BITMAPINFOHEADER in bytes
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    biHeight -- height in pixels
    If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB with the point of origin at the lower left corner.
    If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

12. biBitCount
13. if it can't create output file
14. because it reads only 1 struct
15. 3
16. It moves to a specific location in a file.
17. SEEK_CUR â€“ means that offset will count from current position
18. rickrolled!
